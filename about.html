			<p>Prior to NPower, I attended Ryerson University and currently also possess a B.COM in Global Management.</p> 
			<p>I always had an interest in technology. It always peaked my interest. All the wonderful innovations being programmed and created has always been a subject of wonder in my mind. Which is why, when this opportunity to become a participant of the NPower program presented itself, I leaped at the chance to gain a better understanding of the world of technology.</p>
			
			<p>If I am to describe myself in a few words, I would say that I am a technology enthusiast armed with a Business Background. Therefore, I would like to consider myself the best of both worlds. </p>
